                                    <p>Photo Booth offers a digital photography service via the Photo Booth. You can have your picture taken in the Photo Booth (the “Photo”). You’ll have to provide us with your age, and email address or your mobile phone number, so we can send your photo to you. For that you have to click your photo, then we’ll send it to you by email. You understand and agree that we may also display your photo on the screen outside the Photo Booth. In addition, you agree that we and a partner company may send you advertising and marketing materials with recommendations and information that might be of interest to you. Users under the age of 16 are not eligible for the activity without a guardians permission.</p>
